## Getting Started

### Installation
This project is divided up into 2 sections. There is a front end react part and there is a backend express part. The express portion is in the server folder and the
react portion is in the client folder. These are two different node packages and you will need to ```npm install``` in both folders.

### Running The Servers
To start the react server you can use the command ```npm start``` in the client folder after installing the dependcies. To start the express server use the command
```npm run server``` in the server folder. Please not that the react server required the express server to opearte anywhere beyond the landing page.

## About The Database
The database being used for this project is a mongodb. It is being hosted on the free tier of [MondoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) so the space and speed are both limited. If you wish to view the database in something like MongoDB Compass this url will get you access `mongodb+srv://dbUser:mER6V5dlVljmcy0x@cluster0.wxnsv.mongodb.net/test`. The full schema can be viewed in `schema.json` in the root of this git repo.

## Some Nice to Knows
If you wish to use an already created user the credentials for a premade user are      
- email :`cole@gmails.com`  
- password : `password`
