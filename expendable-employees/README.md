## About The Database
The database being used for this project is a mongodb. It is being hosted on the free tier of [MondoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) so the space and speed are both limited. If you wish to view the database in something like MongoDB Compass this url will get you access `mongodb+srv://dbUser:mER6V5dlVljmcy0x@cluster0.wxnsv.mongodb.net/test`. The full schema can be viewed in `schema.json` in the root of this git repo.
